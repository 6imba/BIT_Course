# Webview:
	# A webView is a browser rendering engine embedded  within native appliation, which is use to display web content within an application.
	# Webview is installed in every devices as a system application.

# Use of Webview:
	- App in your andriod device may have an link to external website, which on click loads the particular webpage.
	- Here external webpage page gets loaded in browser outside the current running app, which is bad user experience as we are out of our appplication.

# Therefore ladies and gentlemen, here I present you Andriod WebView.
	- That loads the external webpage on the top of or inside current running app, without redirecting outside current running application.

# In case, if there was no Webview in our system then we get redirect to another website outside(browser) our current app.

# Therefore main purpose of this system app is to maintain user experience, as we click any link we dont get redirect to some other app.

# Till now we talk WebView as a rendering engine of an device.
# As we know that different device have their own operating system. So various OS has their respective  web rendering engine.
	- WebKIT in iOS: browser on iOS actually uses WebKIT.
	- Blink in Andriod: browser on iOS actually uses Blink.
	- Likewise Window, Linux, macOS have their lots of WebView choices.

There are many framework to implement webView in our project
