Q. ubuntu vs kali linux?

- Unix,
- Unbuntu, Debian, and Fedora
- Arch Linux/Manjaro Linux
- alpine

- Linux operating systems also differ in the way they handle applications. Another major criterion by which the Linux operating systems differ from each other is package management.

- Unics
- Unix

# Flavour of Unix:
    - IBM-AIX
    - SUN Solaris
    - Mac OS
    - HP-Unix
    > lisenced not open source and free
    - # Linux

# Linux:
    - Linus Torvald studied (*Unix & *MINIX os built by professor "Andrew Tanenbaum") and then built Linux Kernel by own from scratch in 1991.
    - So here Linux actually is free&open_source kernel.
    - (1991-1995 free software moment), GNU.
    - Operating_System = Kernel + Software.
    - Linux_Operating_System = Linux_Kernel + GNU_Software.

# Flavour of Linux_Kernel:
    - RHEL (Company)
    - Fedora (Group of people)
    - Dedian
    - Others (ubuntu, centOS, Amazon linux, Kali linux,  Alpine linux)
    > centOS is the fastest.
    > ubuntu 3rd most used OS.
    > Kali linux has some tools which is used mostly in hacking.

# Two ways to used Operating_System:
    - CLI "Command Line Interface"
    - GUI "Graphical User Interface"
    > cmd in window is CLI where we need to give instruction keyboard command.
    > Window Desktop is GUI where we need to give instruction through mouse.
    * Window has both CLI and GUI avialable.
    * Linx also has both CLI and GUI avialable but its GUI is not popular that much.
    => CLI: terminal, command prompt, shell, powershell, command line utility.

# Companies like RHEL, Fedora, Dedian etc has their own different Linux_Distribution.
    - In Linux, distribution means version. (terms)
    - Linux distribution ~ Window Version (7,8,9,10).
    - Linu_Distribution ~ Linux_OS
    - Linux_Distribution: RHEL, Fedora, Dedian, centOS, Amazon, Kali, Alpine, etc.

Q. So why Linux?
    - Microsfot doesnt share its Window_OS code.(Open Sources & free)
    - Microsfot doesnt have options.
    - Secure.(Hacking,Virus)
    - Light-weight
    - Mutiple-distributions

# Andriod has Linux Kernel.
