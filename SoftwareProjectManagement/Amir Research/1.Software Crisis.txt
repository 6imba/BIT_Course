# crisis: a time of intense difficulty or danger.

# Software crisis:
    - Software crisis refers to a series of serious problems encountered in the development and maintenance of computer software.
    - Software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time.
    - Software crisis refers to the phenomenon that a backward software production method cannot meet the rapidly growing demand for computer software, which leads to a series of serious problems in the software development and maintenance process.
    - Software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time
    - If project is not completed/efficient within given time period, then you moving toward software crisis.

# Cycle
    - Software_Industry is changing rapidly.
    - Software_Demand is increasing rapidly.
    - Increase in software complexity.
    -> Using same workforce,methods,tools, for all Software development cycle.
    -> leads to software crisis.

# Some of big Software crisis occured:
    1. Y2Kproblem(Year 2000 problem), Y2K Bug, Millennium Bug, 12-12-1900, **-**-19**, 1999->1900 computer coding solved by India.
        - Time world almost ended.
        - 1999 year calender.
        - Less Memory usage.
        - patch: A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it.
        - Not all computer were affected by this Y2K problem. Y2K was seen in those computers that were using that particular Operating System with 19** bug.

    2. Arian-5 space rocket
    3. banks of US Problem.
    - These are some of three big software_crisis example but in todays time there exists lots of software_crisis in industry.

# Solution:
    - Software Project Management.(Collection of solutions)
    - New project -> new workforce,methods,tools.
    - Delivered software within given time period with no bug.
    > completion_time & bug ~ software quality.
    *Motivate
