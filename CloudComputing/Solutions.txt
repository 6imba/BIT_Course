# Overview:
	- Road-blocks:
	- Team size, Resources, Cost, Project Demand/Size, so on.
	- Problems:
		- Small Team size, Limited resources, Huge Cost, Unpredictability of demands, Headache.
	- System setup for Storage of files & data, 
	- Hire tech team to manage and maintain that particular system,
	- Replace work on local-server/system  to remote-server/system.
	- Minimized cost, headache.ss
	- Services(Resources+System)



Q. What do you mean by cloud? Describe the basic characteristics of the cloud?
	- Cloud Computing is the techology of serving ondemand services over the internet on pay as you go basis.
	- Ondemand services means ~ any services at anytime when required. (instant required services.)
	> Services:
		- Resources: Harware_Component(Processor, RAM, Storage),
		- Software_Component(server_application, program(code), services, DBMS)

	# Characteristics(Advantages) of the cloud computing:
		- On demand self services,
		- Broad network access,
		- Acccessibility(Location independent & Resource Pooling),
		- Scalability,
		- Storage,
		- Maintainance,
		- Security,
		- Relaibility & backup,
		- Cost & Affordable.

	# Challenges(Disadvantages) of cloud computing:
		- Network(internet) connection Dependency,
		- Lack of support by providers,
		- One CSP may not have all the service that you need,
		- Privacy & Data Security
		- Data Recovery and Backup



Q. What type of deployment models can be adopted in cloud computing? Describe each of them with a suitable example.
	# Models of Cloud Computing:
	1. Deployment Model:
		- Public Cloud(Bus): EveryOne can access it,
		- Private Cloud(Car): Specific organization member's can access it
		- Hybrid Cloud(Taxi): Public & Private
		- Community Cloud(): Group of specific organization member's can access it.
	2. Service Model:
		# Architecture of CC: Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization->OS->Middleware->Runtime->Data->Applications.
		- IAAS: Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization->OS
			- infrastructure is provided as an outsource to enterprises such as networking equipment, devices, database, and web servers
			- virtual machine,server,storage,network,load balancer.
		- PAAS: Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization->OS->Middleware->Runtime
			- provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services over the internet. 
			- Database, web server, development tools
		- SAAS: Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization->OS->Middleware->Runtime->Data->Applications
			- way of delivering services and applications over the Internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software, we simply access it via the Internet
			- CRM, email, games
		- On-Premises Model
		> Provides responsible & Client responsible.
		> Cloud clients: Web Browser, Mobile App, etc.



Q. What do you mean by virtualization? What is the role of virtualization in cloud computing?
	
	- Technique of splitting actual data center sphysical machine resources(operating system, a server, a storage device or network resources) into as many virtual logical machinces we want.

	- Types of Virtualization: Network, Storage, Server, Hardware(Platform with OS), Desktop, Application.

	1. Network Virtualization:
		- Virtualizating one single network(LAN,MAN,WAN,so on) into multiple small vitual network.

	2. Server Virtualization:
		- Virtualizating one single server into many Virtual Server.
		> Actual Server -> Hypervisor -> Virtual Servers
		> Actual Server(64GB, 1TB, 32Core) -> Hypervisor -> VS(4GB, 100GB, 2Core) | VS(8GB, 400GB, 16Core) | VS(4GB, 100GB, 2Core)
		> Actual Server(64GB, 1TB, 32Core) -> Hypervisor -> Billing_Server(4GB, 100GB, 2Core) | DHCP_Server(8GB, 400GB, 16Core) | DNS_Server(4GB, 100GB, 2Core)| Firewall_Server(4GB, 100GB, 2Core)
		- Each virtual server machine is isolated.(meaning none of VS can access data of other VS directly, they have to go via switches of Physical catual server)
	
	3. Hardware(Platform with OS)
		- Create multiple virtual instance/version of actual physical harware resources(RAM,ROM,Processor,OS) using virtualization technology.
		> Hardware_resources -> Hypervisor(VMware vSphere/ESXi, Xen/Citrix XenServer) -> OSs -> Software
			- Hardware_resources: physical harware resources(RAM,Storage,Processor,I/O) ==> Host Physical Manchine
			- Virtual Hardware
			- Hypervisor: software or program (VMware vSphere/ESXi, Xen/Citrix XenServer)
			- OS: Window, Linux
			- Virtual Machine
			- Application

	# We need different seperate server for different task.

	# Data center:
		- numbers of physical servers.
		- Storage(Disk) for all servers.
		- Cabling all servers.
		- Cpex & Opex.

	# Advantages:
		- Less power consumption
		- Decreases Cpex & Opex incase of providers.
		- Decreases Cost incase of consumers.
		- Assibility



Q. Discuss about disasters in cloud. How intrusions are detected in cloud?
	- Disasters in cloud is the unfortunate phenomenon, which might cause loss in data or degrade security aspect of cloud.
	- Cloud disaster recovery (CDR) is a cloud-based managed service that helps you quickly recover your organizationâ€™s critical systems after a disaster and provides you remote access to your systems in a secure virtual environment.
	- Cloud disaster recovery is a service that enables the backup and recovery of remote machines on a cloud-based platform.
	- Disasters might be any of:
		- Natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods,
		- Technical failures, such as power failure or network connectivity,
		- Human actions, such as inadvertent misconfiguration or unauthorized/outside party access or modification.



Q. How grid computing differs from cloud computing? Justify what the elasticity and multitenancy properties of cloud computing mean?
