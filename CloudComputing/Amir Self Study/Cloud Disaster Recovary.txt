# Disasters in cloud:
	- Disasters in cloud is the unfortunate phenomenon, which might cause loss in data or degrade security aspect of cloud.
	- Disasters can be any of:
		- Natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods,
		- Technical failures, such as power failure or network connectivity,
		- Human actions, such as inadvertent misconfiguration or unauthorized/outside party access or modification.
# Cloud disaster recovery:
	- Cloud disaster recovery (CDR) is a cloud-based managed service that helps you quickly recover your organizationâ€™s critical systems after a disaster and provides you remote access to your systems in a secure virtual environment.
	- Cloud disaster recovery is a service that enables the backup and recovery of remote machines on a cloud-based platform.

# Cloud disaster recovery plan:
	- Disasters can be anything that puts organization operation at risk, from Cyber attack, Technical equipment failure, Natural disaster.
	- Disaster Recovery Plan is the documented structured step-by-step approach/precaution with instruction for responding/minimizing negative effect at the time of unplandded incidents/disaster, so that organization can contnue/resume critical function/operation esaily and quickly.

# Two of the most important parameters of Disaster Recovery Plan RTO and RPO.

# Recovery Time Objective: RTO
	- It is the Target time duration within which a business process must be restored after a disaster.(RTO of 2 hours, RTO of 3 hours, RTO of 2.5 hours)
	- eg: System went down at 3 pm and resumed at 5pm. ==> RTO is 2 hours.(This means data recovary should be completed within the given time.)
	- How quickly we can resume our operation?

# Recovery Point Objectives: RPO
	- In what interval of time doe we need to to backup our data. It is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss mesured in time.
	- eg: Backup is taken twice, i.e 3:00 AM and at 3:00 PM. RPO of 12 hours indicates that organizations need to ensure that their data loss shouldnt exceed for 12 hours of data captured.
	- How much data will we lose at the time of disaster?
