# Cloud is the technology which provides/serves services over internet.

# Cloud Services:
	- IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service) --> System Administrative use it.
	- PAAS(Platform as a Service) --> Developer use it. --> Heroku, 
	- SAAS(Software as a Service) --> Client User use it. --> GIT

# Service Model of Cloud:
	# Layers in model:
	1. Network(Router, Gateway, Firewall)
	2. Storage(Save data)
	3. Server(Serve services)
	4. Virtualization(Virtual form of 1,2,3)
	5. OS ***************************************
	6. Middleware
	7. Runtime
	8. Data
	9. Application

	# IAAS: 1,2,3,4.
		- Infrastructure: Hardwares Services Virtualization. 
		- Virtual form(4) of 1,2,3.
	# PAAS: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
		- Platform: Place to run Service(like MySQL for Database, so on)
	# SAAS: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
		- Software: 



# Deployment Model of Cloud:
	1. Public Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure -(It can provide virtual private cloud as well)
	2. Private Cloud: Enterprise Cloud ==> Dell Company Cloud: head and branchs, Samsung Company Cloud: head and branchs ==> Private Cloud of Individual Companies, more secured.
	3. Hybrid Cloud: Public & Private Cloud.



# Virtualization:
	1. Network
	2. Storage
	3. Server
	   ***Hypervisor***
	4. Virtualization
	5. Cloud

	- Hypervisor in Microsoft is HyperV.
	- Hypervisor in AWS is Citrix.
	- Hypervisor in VMware is Vsphere_ESXI_6.5.

	- By virtualizing infrastructure according to requirement you create cloud service.
