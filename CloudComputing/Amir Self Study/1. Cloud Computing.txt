# Services based on Cloud_Computing: 
	- Company: Services
	- Goggle: Gmail, GogglePhoto, GoogleDrive,
	- Microsoft: OneDrive,
	- Netflix: NETFLIX,
	- Amazon: amazonprime,



# Cloud Computing:
	- Cloud computing is a technology that uses the internet for storing and managing data on remote servers and then access data via the internet.
	- Cloud Computing is providing ondemand services over/through the internet.
	- Ondemand services means ~ any services at anytime when required. (instant required services.)
	> Services:
		- Resources: Harware_Component(Processor, RAM, Storage),
		- Software_Component(server_application, program(code), services, DBMS)



# Terminology:
	- Server is computer that serves services.



# Established StartUp:
	- Road-blocks:
		- Team size, Resources, Cost, Project Demand/Size, so on.
	- Problems:
		- Small Team size, Limited resources, Huge Cost, Unpredictability of demands, Headache.

	- System setup for Storage of files & data, 
	- Hire tech team to manage and maintain that particular system,
	- Replace work on local-server/system  to remote-server/system.
	- Minimized cost, headache.ss
	- Services(Resources+System)

- Problems:
	- 

- Cloud computing is the use of remote services on the remote server on the internet to store, manage, and process data instead of local servers.
- Cloud Computing Services: Resources&Sevices + System via inertnet.



Q. Who provide cloud services? ===> Cloud Service Provider
	- Cloud Providers: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Provider, Alibaba Cloud, iCloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle, etc.



- Cloud Computing Services:
	- Ondemand services means ~ any services at anytime when required.
	- Most of the cloud-services has: Pay-as-you-go model. ~ means pay as your usage of particular services.
	- Cloud Company is responsible for all infrastructure like Security, Maintainance, Tech Team, etc.
	- Thats why most of the company nowadays does theirs tasks(data-storage, computing,) via cloud computing services.

- System Specification propertional_to Task Performace.

- On-Premises VS Cloud.
	> Basis: Scalability(Cost&Services-Option), Server Storage(space&power), Data Security(Securities Measures), Data Loss(Data Recovery), Maintainance(TechTeams).
	> Compare cost & time of these basis on both side.

# Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of ondemanding computing-services over/through the internet on pay as you go basis.
- Avoid Local, Go Remote.

# Models of Cloud Computing:
	1. Deployment Model: Public Cloud(Bus), Private Cloud(Car), Hybrid Cloud(Taxi), Community Cloud().
	2. Service Model: IAAS, PAAS, SAAS.

1. Deployment Model:
	- Public Cloud: Gmail,
		- EveryOne can access it,
		- 
	- Private Cloud: 
		- Specific organization member's can access it,
		- 
	- Hybrid Cloud: 
		- Public & Private
		- 
	- Community Cloud: 
		- Group of specific organization member's can access it,
		- 




# Data Center: Building that
	> Consist of:
		- Multiple (Server, Storage, Other Resources)
	> Responsibilites
		- Compute Big Data, Support Cloud Computing, Serve Many Services.
	> Multiple Data center (their Location & Computation)
	> Scalibility



# Single Tenant vs Multitenant
	- tenant: a person who occupies land or property rented from a landlord.
	- load balancer



# DataStorage vs Database vs DataWarehouse vs DataLake.
# Cloud Storage System: Goggle_Drive_15GB, Microsoft_OneDrive_15GB, DropBox_2GB.
	> data: text, image, image, email, etc.



# Type of Data Storage & Its representation.
	> 

# Advantages:
	- Setup you server system with in couple of minutes.(Incase of local server it might takes 1 year)
	- Cloud Serve Infrastucture.(IT infreastructure: License, Router, Switches, Gateway, Firewall, Antivirus, Server, so on)
	- Cloud Serve Platform. ()
	- Cloud Serve Software.



# Cloud Services: Infrastucture, Platform, Software.
# You access cloud services remotely using CLI or GUI.
# Cloud data_center region.(avialability zone)

- What ever you are accessing via internet that is cloud.(without internet(not LAN,MAN), there is no cloud)
- Cloud is the technology via which you can access and manipulate remote resources.
- Cloud is the technology which provides/serves services over internet.
